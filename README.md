# 📱 SwiftUI Product List App

This project is a simple and modern iOS app built using **SwiftUI**, following **MVVM architecture**, with **Dependency Injection**, **Swift Concurrency (async/await)**, and **Combine**.

It displays a list of products, allows bookmarking, and shows product details. Designed to showcase clean MVVM architecture with modern Swift features like async/await and Combine.

## 🧱 Architecture

- **MVVM**: Clean separation of UI, logic, and data
