# 📱 SwiftUI Product List App

This project is a simple and modern iOS app built using **SwiftUI**, following **MVVM architecture**, with **Dependency Injection**, **Swift Concurrency (async/await)**, and **Combine**.

It displays a list of products, allows bookmarking, and shows product details. Designed to showcase clean MVVM architecture with modern Swift features like async/await and Combine.


## ✅ Features

- Grouped product list by category
- Bookmark and unbookmark products
- Real-time updates using Combine
- Async data loading using `async/await`
- Mock API service for testing
- Unit tests for product list view model

## 🧱 Architecture

- **MVVM**: Clean separation of UI, logic, and data
- **DI**: Dependency Injection containers per feature
- **Swift Concurrency**: Used for async API calls
- **Combine**: Used for reactive state updates (bookmarking)
- **SwiftUI**: Entire UI is built in SwiftUI with previews
